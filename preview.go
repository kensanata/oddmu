// previewHandler is a bit like saveHandler and viewHandler. Instead of saving the date to a page, we create a synthetic
// Page and render it. Note that when saving, the carriage returns (\r) are removed. We need to do this as well,
// otherwise the rendered template has garbage bytes at the end. Note also that we need to remove the title from the
// page so that the preview works as intended (and much like the "view.html" template) where as the editing requires the
// page content including the headerâ€¦ which is why it needs to be added in the "preview.html" template. This makes me
// sad.
