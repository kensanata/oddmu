ODDMU-FILTER(7)

# NAME

oddmu-filter - keeping subdirectories separate

# DESCRIPTION

There are actions such as searching and archiving that act on multiple pages,
not just a single page. These actions walk the directory tree, including all
subdirectories. In some cases, this is not desirable.

Sometimes, subdirectories are separate sites, like the sites of other projects
or different people. Essentially, the subdirectory acts as a different site.
Depending on how you think about it, you might not want to include those "sites"
in searches or archives of the whole site.

What's important in this situation is whether the visitor is looking at the
"main site" (a page further up in the directory tree) or at a particular page in
a "separate site".

Since directory tree actions always start in the directory the visitor is
currenly looking at, directory tree actions starting in a "separate site"
automatically act as expected. The action is limited to that subdirectory tree.

When visitors look at a page in the "main site", however, directory tree actions
must skip any sub directories that are part of a "separate site".

The way to identify separate sates is via the environment variable ODDMU_FILTER.
It's value is a regular expression matching separate sites.

# EXAMPLES

"ODDMU_FILTER=^project/" means that a directory tree action outside the
"project/" directory does not include pages in the "project/" directory.

In other words, http://localhost:8080/search/?q=oddmu skips any pages in
"project/".

At the same time, http://localhost:8080/search/project/?q=oddmu works like it
always does: search is limited to "project/" and its subdirectories.

# SECURITY

If the subdirectory is a private site, then you need to use ODDMU_FILTER to
exclude it from directory tree actions in the main site, and you need to
configure your web server such that it doesn't allow visitors access to the
directory tree without authentication. See _oddmu-apache_(5).
