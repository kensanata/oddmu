.TH "ODDMU-REPLACE" "1" "2023-10-07"
.PP
.SH NAME
.PP
oddmu-replace - replace text in Oddmu pages from the command-line
.PP
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBoddmu replace\fR [-confirm] [-regexp] \fIterm\fR \fIreplacement\fR
.PP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The "replace" subcommand does a search and replace on all the Markdown
files in the current directory and its subdirectories.\&
.PP
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
\fB-confirm\fR
.RS 4
By default, the replacement doesn'\&t save the changes made.\&
Instead, a unified diff is produced and printed.\& Given this
option, the changed Markdown files are saved to disk.\&
.PP
.RE
\fB-regexp\fR
.RS 4
By default, the term to be replaced is just a string.\& With
this flag, the term is a regular expression and the
replacement can contain backreferences ($1, $2, $3, etc.\&) to
capture groups.\&
.PP
.RE
.SH EXAMPLE
.PP
Replace "Oddmu" in the Markdown files of the current directory:
.PP
.nf
.RS 4
oddmu replace Oddmu OddÂµ
.fi
.RE
.PP
Result:
.PP
.nf
.RS 4
--- README\&.md~
+++ README\&.md

(diff omitted)

1 file would be changed\&.
This is a dry run\&. Use -confirm to make it happen\&.

.SH NOTES
.PP
This is the equivalent of using \fIsed\fR(1) with the --quiet,
--regexp-extended, --in-place=~ and --expression command with the s
command "s/regexp/replacement/g" except that it prints a unified diff
per default instead of making any changes and the regexp rules differ
slightly.\&
.PP
The search is case-sensitive.\& To make it case-insensitive, search for
a regular expression that sets the case-insensitive flag, e.\&g.\&
"(?\&i)oddmu".\&
