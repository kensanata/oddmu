ODDMU-NOTIFY(1)

# NAME

oddmu-notify - add links to changes.md, index.md, and hashtag pages

# SYNOPSIS

*oddmu notify* _page names..._ 

# DESCRIPTION

The "notify" subcommand takes all the Markdown files provided and adds links to
these pages from other pages.

A new link is added to the *changes* page in the current directory if it doesn't
exist. The current date of the machine Oddmu is running on is used as the
heading. If the requested link already exists on the changes page, it is moved
up to the current date. If that leaves an old date without any links, that date
heading is removed.

A page whose name starts with an ISO date (YYYY-MM-DD, e.g. "2023-10-28") is
called a *blog* page.

A link is created from the *index* page in the current directory to blog pages
if and only if the blog pages are from the current year. The idea is that the
front page contains a lot of links to blog posts but eventually the blog post
links are moved onto archive pages (one per year, for example), or simply
deleted. As when editing older pages, links to those pages should not get added
to the index as if those older pages were new again. A link on the changes page
is enough.

For every *hashtag* used on the pages named, another link might be created. If a
page named like the hashtag exists, a backlink is added to it. A hashtag
consists of a number sign ('#') followed by Unicode letters, numbers or the
underscore ('\_'). Thus, a hashtag ends with punctuation or whitespace.

If a link already exists but it's title is no longer correct, it is updated.

New links added for blog pages are added at the top of the first unnumbered list
using the asterisk ('\*'). If no such list exists, a new one is started at the
bottom of the page. This allows you to have a different unnumbered list further
up on the page, as long as it uses the minus for items ('-').

# EXAMPLES

After writing the file "2023-11-05-climate.md" containing the hashtag
"#Climate", add links to it from "index.md", "changes.md", and "Climate.md" (if
it exists):

```
oddmu notify 2023-11-05-climate.md
```

The changes file might look as follows:

```
# Changes

This page lists all the changes made to the wiki.
