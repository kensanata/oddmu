oddmu-search - understanding the Oddmu search engine
.PP
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBoddmu search\fR \fIterms\fR.\&.\&.\&
.PP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The index indexes trigrams.\& Each group of three characters is a
trigram.\& A document with content "This is a test" is turned to lower
case and indexed under the trigrams "thi", "his", "is ", "s i", " is",
"is ", "s a", " a ", "a t", " te", "tes", "est".\&
.PP
Each query is split into words and then processed the same way.\& A
query with the words "this test" is turned to lower case and produces
the trigrams "thi", "his", "tes", "est".\& This means that the word
order is not considered when searching for documents.\&
.PP
This also means that there is no stemming.\& Searching for "testing"
won'\&t find "This is a test" because there are no matches for the
trigrams "sti", "tin", "ing".\&
.PP
These trigrams are looked up in the index, resulting in the list of
documents.\& Each document found is then scored.\& Each of the following
increases the score by one point:
.PP
.PD 0
.IP \(bu 4
the entire phrase matches
.IP \(bu 4
a word matches
.IP \(bu 4
a word matches at the beginning of a word
.IP \(bu 4
a word matches at the end of a word
.IP \(bu 4
a word matches as a whole word
.PD
.PP
A document with content "This is a test" when searched with the phrase
"this test" therefore gets a score of 8: the entire phrase does not
match but each word gets four points.\&
.PP
Trigrams are sometimes strange: In a text containing the words "main"
and "rail", a search for "mail" returns a match because the trigrams
"mai" and "ail" are found.\& In this situation, the result has a score
of 0.\&
.PP
The sorting of all the pages, however, does not depend on scoring!\&
Computing the score is expensive because the page must be loaded from
disk.\& Therefore, results are sorted by title:
.PP
.PD 0
.IP \(bu 4
If the page title contains the query string, it gets sorted first.\&
.IP \(bu 4
If the page name (the filename!\&) begins with a number, it is sorted
descending.\&
.IP \(bu 4
All other pages follow, sorted ascending.\&
.PD
.PP
The effect is that first, the pages with matches in the page title are
shown, and then all the others.\& Within these two groups, the most
recent blog posts are shown first.\& This assumes that blog pages start
with an ISO date like "2023-09-16".\&
.PP
The score and highlighting of snippets is used to help visitors decide
which links to click.\& A score of 0 indicates that all the trigrams
were found but \fIno exact matches\fR for any of the terms.\&
