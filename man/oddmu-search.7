oddmu-search - understanding the Oddmu search engine
.PP
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBoddmu search\fR \fIterms\fR.\&.\&.\&
.PP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The wiki keeps an index of all the hash tags and page titles in memory.\& Using
hashtags and predicates in your queries speeds them up because fewer files are
opened.\&
.PP
A hashtag starts with a number sign ('\&#'\&) and contains numbers, letters, and the
underscore ('\&_'\&).\&
.PP
Example: #old_school random encounter
.PP
The title predicate filters for pages where the term is contained in the page
title.\&
.PP
Example: title:geo title:cache z√ºrich
.PP
The blog predicate filters for pages where the page name begins with an ISO date
like "2023-09-26" if true, or doesn'\&t begin with an ISO date if false.\&
.PP
Example: blog:false fountain
.PP
The sorting of all the pages does not depend on the number of matches or any
kind of score because computing the score is expensive as this requires the page
to be loaded from disk.\& Therefore, results are sorted by title:
.PP
.PD 0
.IP \(bu 4
If a page title matches the query string exactly, it gets sorted first.\&
.IP \(bu 4
If the page title contains the query string, it gets sorted next.\&
.IP \(bu 4
If the page name starts with a number, it is sorted descending.\&
.IP \(bu 4
All other pages follow, sorted ascending.\&
.PD
.PP
The effect is that first, the pages with matches in the page title are shown,
and then all the others.\& Within these two groups, the most recent blog posts are
shown first.\& This assumes that blog pages start with an ISO date like
"2023-09-16".\&
.PP
When searching for a hashtag, a page matching the hashtag exactly (without the
leading '\&#'\&) is listed first, even if it doesn'\&t contain the hashtag.\& It is
assumed that this page offers some kind of introduction to people searching for
the hashtag.\&
.PP
The score and highlighting of snippets is used to help visitors decide which
links to click.\&
.PP
Each document found is scored.\& Each of the following increases the score by one
point:
.PP
.PD 0
.IP \(bu 4
the entire phrase matches
.IP \(bu 4
a word matches
.IP \(bu 4
a word matches at the beginning of a word
.IP \(bu 4
a word matches at the end of a word
.IP \(bu 4
a word matches as a whole word
.PD
.PP
A document with content "This is a test" when searched with the phrase "this
test" therefore gets a score of 8: the entire phrase does not match but each
word gets four points.\&
