ODDMU.SERVICE(5)

# NAME

oddmu.service - how to setup Oddmu using systemd

## DESCRIPTION

Here's how to setup a wiki using systemd such that it starts
automatically when the system boots and gets restarted automatically
when it crashes.

First, create a new user called "oddmu" with it's own home directory
but without a login.

```
adduser --system --home /home/oddmu oddmu
```

The directory "/home/oddmu" contains the templates and all the data
files. Copy all the tempaltes files ending in ".html" from the source
distribution to "/home/oddmu".

If you want to keep everything in one place, copy the binary "oddmu"
and the service file "oddmu.service" to "/home/oddmu", too.

Edit the `oddmu.service` file. These are the lines you most likely
have to take care of:

```
ExecStart=/home/oddmu/oddmu
WorkingDirectory=/home/oddmu
Environment="ODDMU_PORT=8080"
Environment="ODDMU_WEBFINGER=1"
```

Install the service file and enable it:

```
ln -s /home/oddmu/oddmu.service /etc/systemd/system/
systemctl enable --now oddmu
```

You should be able to visit the wiki at
http://localhost:8080/.

Check the log:

```
journalctl --unit oddmu
```

Follow the log:

```
journalctl --follow --unit oddmu
```
