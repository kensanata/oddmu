ODDMU.SERVICE(5)

# NAME

oddmu.service - how to setup Oddmu using systemd

## DESCRIPTION

Here's how to setup a wiki using systemd such that it starts automatically when
the system boots and gets restarted automatically when it crashes.

First, create a new user called "oddmu" with it's own home directory but without
a login.

```
adduser --system --home /home/oddmu oddmu
```

The directory "/home/oddmu" contains the templates and all the data files. Copy
all the templates files ending in ".html" from the source distribution to
"/home/oddmu".

If you want to keep everything in one place, copy the binary "oddmu" and the
service file "oddmu.service" to "/home/oddmu", too.

Edit the `oddmu.service` file. These are the lines you most likely have to take
care of:

```
ExecStart=/home/oddmu/oddmu
WorkingDirectory=/home/oddmu
Environment="ODDMU_PORT=8080"
Environment="ODDMU_WEBFINGER=1"
```

Install the service file and enable it:

```
ln -s /home/oddmu/oddmu.service /etc/systemd/system/
systemctl enable --now oddmu
```

You should be able to visit the wiki at http://localhost:8080/.

Check the log:

```
journalctl --unit oddmu
```

Follow the log:

```
journalctl --follow --unit oddmu
```

For it to restart when the server reboots:

```
sudo ln -sf /home/oddmu/oddmu.service \
  /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/
```

# Socket Activation

Alternatively, you can let systemd handle the creation of the listening socket,
passing it to Oddmu. See "oddmu-unix-domain.service" and
"oddmu-unix-domain.socket" for a fully worked example of how to do this with a
Unix domain socket. Take note of "Accept=no" in the .socket file and
"StandardInput=socket" in the .service file. The option "StandardInput=socket"
tells systemd to pass the socket to the service as its standard input.
"Accept=no" tells systemd to pass a listening socket, rather than to try calling
Oddmu for each connection.

The instructions for starting and enabling the systemd service are almost
exactly the same as those in the previous section, with "oddmu.service" replaced
by "oddmu-unix-domain.service". You'll also need to run the following:

```
ln -s /home/oddmu/oddmu-unix-domain.socket /etc/systemd/system
```
