ODDMU(5) "File Formats Manual"

# NAME

oddmu - text formatting of wiki pages

# SYNTAX

The wiki pages are UTF-8 encoded Markdown files.

There are three Oddµ-specific extensions: local links, hashtags and
fediverse account links. The Markdown library used features some
additional extensions, most importantly tables and definition lists.

## Local links

Local links use double square brackets [[like this]].

## Hashtags

Hashtags are single word links to searches for themselves. Use the
underscore to use hashtags consisting of multiple words. Hashtags are
distinguished from page titles because there is no space after the
hash.

```
# Title

Text

#Tag #Another_Tag
```

## Tables

A table with footers and a columnspan:

```
Name    | Age
--------|------
Bob     ||
Alice   | 23
========|======
Total   | 23
```

## Definition lists:

```
Cat
: Fluffy animal everyone likes

Internet
: Vector of transmission for pictures of cats
```

## Fediverse account links

Fediverse accounts look a bit like an at sign followed by an email
address, e.g. @alex@alexschroeder.ch. When rendering a page, these
turn into a username linked to a profile page. In this case, "@alex"
would be linked to "https://alexschroeder.ch/users/alex".

In many cases, this will work as is. In reality, however, the link to
the profile page needs to be retrieved via webfinger. Oddµ does that
in the background, and as soon as the information is available, the
actual profile link is used when pages are rendered. In the example
above, the result would be "https://social.alexschroeder.ch/@alex".

## Other extensions

The Markdown processor comes with a few extensions:

* emphasis markers inside words are ignored
* fenced code blocks are supported
* autolinking of "naked" URLs are supported
* strikethrough using two tildes is supported (~~like this~~)
* it is strict about prefix heading rules
* you can specify an id for headings ({#id})
* trailing backslashes turn into line breaks
* MathJax is supported (but needs a separte setup)

# PERCENT ENCODING

If you use Markdown links to local pages, you must percent-encode the
link target. Any character that is not an "unreserved character"
according to RFC 3986 might need to be encoded. The unreserved
characters are a-z, A-Z, 0-9, as well as the four characters '-',
'\_', '.' and '~'.

Percent-encoding means that each character is converted into one or
more bytes, and each byte is represented as a percent character
followed by a hexadecimal representation.

Realistically, what probably works best is to use a browser. If you
type "http://example.org/Alex Schröder" into the address bar, you'll
get sent to the example domain. If you now copy the address and paste
it back into a text editor, you'll get
"http://example.org/Alex%20Schr%C3%B6der" and that's how you'll learn
that the Space is encoded by %20 and that the character 'ö' is encoded
by %C3%B6. To link to the page "Alex Schröder" you would write
something like this: "[Alex](Alex%20Schr%C3%B6der)".
