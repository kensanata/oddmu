oddmu - text formatting of wiki pages
.PP
.SH SYNTAX
.PP
The wiki pages are UTF-8 encoded Markdown files.\&
.PP
There are three Oddµ-specific extensions: local links, hashtags and
fediverse account links.\& The Markdown library used features some
additional extensions, most importantly tables and definition lists.\&
.PP
.SS Local links
.PP
Local links use double square brackets [[like this]].\&
.PP
.SS Hashtags
.PP
Hashtags are single word links to searches for themselves.\& Use the
underscore to use hashtags consisting of multiple words.\& Hashtags are
distinguished from page titles because there is no space after the
hash.\&

.SS Fediverse account links
.PP
Fediverse accounts look a bit like an at sign followed by an email
address, e.\&g.\& @alex@alexschroeder.\&ch.\& When rendering a page, these
turn into a username linked to a profile page.\& In this case, "@alex"
would be linked to "https://alexschroeder.\&ch/users/alex".\&
.PP
In many cases, this will work as is.\& In reality, however, the link to
the profile page needs to be retrieved via webfinger.\& Oddµ does that
in the background, and as soon as the information is available, the
actual profile link is used when pages are rendered.\& In the example
above, the result would be "https://social.\&alexschroeder.\&ch/@alex".\&
.PP
As this sort of packground network activity is surprising, it is not
enabled by default.\& Set the environment variable ODDMU_WEBFINGER to
"1" in order to enable this.\&
.PP
.SS Other extensions
.PP
The Markdown processor comes with a few extensions:
.PP
\fB emphasis markers inside words are ignored
\fR fenced code blocks are supported
\fB autolinking of "naked" URLs are supported
\fR strikethrough using two tildes is supported (~~like this~~)
\fB it is strict about prefix heading rules
\fR you can specify an id for headings ({#id})
\fB trailing backslashes turn into line breaks
\fR MathJax is supported (but needs a separte setup)
.PP
.SH PERCENT ENCODING
.PP
If you use Markdown links to local pages, you must percent-encode the
link target.\& Any character that is not an "unreserved character"
according to RFC 3986 might need to be encoded.\& The unreserved
characters are a-z, A-Z, 0-9, as well as the four characters '\&-'\&,
\&'\&_'\&, '\&.\&'\& and '\&~'\&.\&
.PP
Percent-encoding means that each character is converted into one or
more bytes, and each byte is represented as a percent character
followed by a hexadecimal representation.\&
.PP
Realistically, what probably works best is to use a browser.\& If you
type "http://example.\&org/Alex Schröder" into the address bar, you'\&ll
get sent to the example domain.\& If you now copy the address and paste
it back into a text editor, you'\&ll get
"http://example.\&org/Alex%20Schr%C3%B6der" and that'\&s how you'\&ll learn
that the Space is encoded by %20 and that the character '\&ö'\& is encoded
by %C3%B6.\& To link to the page "Alex Schröder" you would write
something like this: "[Alex](Alex%20Schr%C3%B6der)".\&
