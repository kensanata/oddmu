oddmu - text formatting of wiki pages
.PP
.SH SYNTAX
.PP
The wiki pages are UTF-8 encoded Markdown files (with the ".\&md" extension).\&
Oddmu links are regular Markdown links to page names (without the ".\&md"
extension):
.PP
.nf
.RS 4
[link text](page-name)
.fi
.RE
.PP
The page name has to be percent-encoded.\& See the section "Percent Encoding".\&
.PP
If you link to the actual Markdown file (with the ".\&md" extension), then Oddmu
serves the Markdown file!\&
.PP
There are three Oddµ-specific extensions: local links, hashtags and fediverse
account links.\& The Markdown library used features some additional extensions,
most importantly tables and definition lists.\&
.PP
.SS Local links
.PP
Local links use double square brackets [[like this]].\& Oddmu does not treat
underscores like spaces, so [[like this]] and [[like_this]] link to different
destinations and are served by different files: "like this.\&md" and
"like_this.\&md".\&
.PP
.SS Hashtags
.PP
Hashtags are single word links to searches for themselves.\& Use the underscore to
use hashtags consisting of multiple words.\& Hashtags are distinguished from page
titles because there is no space after the hash.\&
.PP
.nf
.RS 4
# Example

Text

#Tag #Another_Tag
.fi
.RE
.PP
When a page containing hashtags is saved, a link to that page is added to every
page with the same name as the hashtag, if it exists.\& In the example above, if
the file "Tag.\&md" or the file "Another_Tag.\&md" exists, a link to the Example
page is added.\&
.PP
.SS Tables
.PP
A table with footers and a columnspan:
.PP
.nf
.RS 4
Name    | Age
--------|------
Bob     ||
Alice   | 23
========|======
Total   | 23
.fi
.RE
.PP
.SS Definition lists:
.PP
.nf
.RS 4
Cat
: Fluffy animal everyone likes

Internet
: Vector of transmission for pictures of cats
.fi
.RE
.PP
.SS Fediverse account links
.PP
Fediverse accounts look a bit like an at sign followed by an email address, e.\&g.\&
@alex@alexschroeder.\&ch.\& When rendering a page, these turn into a username linked
to a profile page.\& In this case, "@alex" would be linked to
"https://alexschroeder.\&ch/users/alex".\&
.PP
In many cases, this works as is.\& In reality, however, the link to the profile
page needs to be retrieved via webfinger.\& Oddµ does that in the background, and
as soon as the information is available, the actual profile link is used when
pages are rendered.\& In the example above, the result would be
"https://social.\&alexschroeder.\&ch/@alex".\&
.PP
As this sort of packground network activity is surprising, it is not enabled by
default.\& Set the environment variable ODDMU_WEBFINGER to "1" in order to enable
this.\&
.PP
.SS Other extensions
.PP
The Markdown processor comes with a few extensions:
.PP
.PD 0
.IP \(bu 4
emphasis markers inside words are ignored
.IP \(bu 4
fenced code blocks are supported
.IP \(bu 4
autolinking of "naked" URLs are supported
.IP \(bu 4
strikethrough using two tildes is supported (~~like this~~)
.IP \(bu 4
it is strict about prefix heading rules
.IP \(bu 4
you can specify an id for headings ({#id})
.IP \(bu 4
trailing backslashes turn into line breaks
.PD
.PP
.SH FEEDS
.PP
Every file can be viewed as feed by using the extension ".\&rss".\& The feed items
are based on links in bullet lists using the asterix ("*").\& The items must
point to local pages.\& This is why the link may not contain two forward slashes
("//").\&
.PP
Assume this is the index page.\& The feed would be "/view/index.\&rss".\& It would
contain the pages "Arianism", "Donatism" and "Monophysitism" but it would not
contain the pages "Feed" and "About" since the list items don'\&t start with an
asterix.\&
.PP
.nf
.RS 4
# Main Page

Hello and welcome! Here are some important links:

- [Feed](index\&.rss)
- [About](about)

Recent posts:

* [Arianism](arianism)
* [Donatism](donatism)
* [Monophysitism](monophysitism)
.fi
.RE
.PP
The feed contains at most 10 items, starting at the top.\&
.PP
.SH PERCENT ENCODING
.PP
If you use Markdown links to local pages, you must percent-encode the link
target.\& Any character that is not an "unreserved character" according to RFC
3986 might need to be encoded.\& The unreserved characters are a-z, A-Z, 0-9, as
well as the four characters '\&-'\&, '\&_'\&, '\&.\&'\& and '\&~'\&.\&
.PP
Percent-encoding means that each character is converted into one or more bytes,
and each byte is represented as a percent character followed by a hexadecimal
representation.\&
.PP
Realistically, what probably works best is to use a browser.\& If you type
"http://example.\&org/Alex Schröder" into the address bar, you'\&ll get sent to the
example domain.\& If you now copy the address and paste it back into a text
editor, you'\&ll get "http://example.\&org/Alex%20Schr%C3%B6der" and that'\&s how
you'\&ll learn that the Space is encoded by %20 and that the character '\&ö'\& is
encoded by %C3%B6.\& To link to the page "Alex Schröder" you would write something
like this: "[Alex](Alex%20Schr%C3%B6der)".\&
.PP
Another thing that'\&s common is that your page name contains a colon.\&
This is legal.\& The URL parser might still reject it.\& If you run the
"missing" subcommand, you'\&ll get to see error: "first path segment in
URL cannot contain colon".\& The solution is to prepend ".\&/"!\&
