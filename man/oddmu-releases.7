oddmu-releases - what'\&s new in this releases?\&
.PP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This page lists user-visible features and template changes to consider.\&
.PP
.SS 1.7 (2024)
.PP
Allow upload of multiple files.\& This requires an update to the upload.\&html
template: Add the \fImultiple\fR attribute to the file input element and change the
label from "file" to "files".\&
.PP
Fix orientation of uploaded images.\& JPG and HEIC images have EXIF data telling a
viewer how to orient the image.\& Oddmu now uses this information to rotate the
image correctly before stripping it.\&
.PP
The version command now displays much less information unless given the -full
argument.\&
.PP
.SS 1.6 (2024)
.PP
Add \fIarchive\fR action to serve a zip file.\&
.PP
.SS 1.5 (2024)
.PP
Filtering separate sites in subdirectories via the ODDMU_FILTER environment
variable in order to exclude them from the \fIsearch\fR action.\&
.PP
Add \fIversion\fR subcommand.\&
.PP
Add filesystem watchers to automatically reindex changed pages and reload
changed templates.\&
.PP
When rendering a page, use templates in the same directory, if available.\&
.PP
Delete uploaded files by uploading a file with zero bytes.\&
.PP
.SS 1.4 (2024)
.PP
If stdin is a Unix-domain socket, use that to serve the site.\& Otherwise, allow
specifying a listen address via the ODDMU_ADDRESS environment variable.\&
.PP
.SS 1.3 (2024)
.PP
Add support for resizing HEIC images (and saving them as JPG files).\&
.PP
.SS 1.2 (2023)
.PP
Add \fIlist\fR subcommand.\&
.PP
.SS 1.1 (2023)
.PP
Rewrote most of the README into man pages.\&
.PP
Add fediverse account rendering if ODDMU_WEBFINGER is set.\&
.PP
Add notifications when saving files: adding links to \fIindex\fR, \fIchanges\fR and
\fIhashtag\fR pages.\&
.PP
Add \fIreplace\fR subcommand.\& Add \fImissing\fR subcommand.\& Add \fInotify\fR command.\& Add
\fIstatic\fR command.\&

Add \fIdiff\fR action.\&
.PP
Add feed generation based on the local links from a page.\&

providing a Last-Modified header in responses.\&
.PP
Handle HEAD requests.\&
.PP
Remove HTML sanitization.\&
.PP
Remove MathJax support from the wiki parser.\& The templates never included the
necessary MathJax JavaScript anyway so the special handling of $ was just an
annoyance.\&
.PP
Drop trigram index and just search all the files.\& This takes much less RAM and
doesn'\&t take too much time even with a few thousand pages.\&
.PP
Add "blog:true" and "blog:false" predicates to search.\&
.PP
Limit search to the current directory tree.\&
.PP
Do not overwrite fresh backups: there must be a 1h break before the backup is
overwritten.\&

Rename the \fIsaveUpload\fR action to \fIdrop\fR.\&
.PP
Add the \fIsearch\fR subcommand.\&
.PP
.SS 0.7 (2023)
.PP
Add \fIupload\fR and \fIsaveUpload\fR action so that one can upload files.\&
.PP
Add \fIhtml\fR subcommand.\&
.PP
.SS 0.6 (2003)
.PP
Add \fIadd\fR and \fIappend\fR action so that one can add to an existing page.\& This is
important for me as editing pages on the phone can be cumbersome but leaving
comments on my own site has always been easy to do.\&
