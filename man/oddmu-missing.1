.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The "missing" subcommand lists pages and their local links that are missing.\&
.PP
Any links that seem like they might point outside the wiki are ignored: links
that start with a slash "/" and links that start with a known URL schema
(currently: "http:", "https:", "ftp:", "mailto:", "gopher:", "gemini:",
"finger:").\&
.PP
Notably, links that start with ".\&.\&/" are reported as missing.\&
