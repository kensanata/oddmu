ODDMU-SEARCH(1)

# NAME

oddmu-search - search the Oddmu pages

# SYNOPSIS

*oddmu search* [-extract] [-page _n_] _terms..._

# DESCRIPTION

The "search" subcommand resursively searches the Markdown files in the current
directory tree. That is, the files in the current directory and all its child
directories are searched.

Be default, this returns a Markdown-formatted list suitable for pasting into
Oddmu pages.

If a directory is provided, only files from the tree starting at that
subdirectory are listed, and the directory is stripped from the page name.

If multiple terms are provided, they are all concatenated into a single,
space-separated query string. That is, searching for the terms A B and the term
"A B" is equivalent.

See _oddmu-search_(7) for more information of how pages are searched, sorted and
scored.

# OPTIONS

*-dir* _string_
	Limit search to a particular directory.
*-extract*
	Print search extracts for interactive use
*-page* _n_
	Search results are paginated and by default only the first page is
	shown. This option allows you to view other pages.
*-all*
	Ignore pagination and just print a long list of results.

# EXAMPLES

Search for the two words "Alex" and "Schroeder". All of the following are
equivalent: Alex Schroeder, Schroeder Alex, "Alex Schroeder", "Schroeder Alex".
The ordering of terms does not matter.

```
~/src/oddmu $ oddmu search Alex Schroeder
Search for Alex Schroeder, page 1: 3 results
* [Alex Schroeder theme](themes/alexschroeder.ch/README)
* [OddÎ¼: A minimal wiki](README)
* [Themes](themes/index)
```

Search for the exact phrase "Alex Schroeder". In order to pass the quotes to
Oddmu, a second level of quotes is required. All of the following are
equivalent: '"Alex Schroeder"', "'Alex Schroeder'", \\"Alex\\ Schroeder\\",
\\"Alex Schroeder\\".

```
~/src/oddmu $ oddmu search "'Alex Schroeder'"
Search for 'Alex Schroeder', page 1: 1 result
* [Alex Schroeder theme](themes/alexschroeder.ch/README)
```
