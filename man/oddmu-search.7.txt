ODDMU-SEARCH(7)

# NAME

oddmu-search - understanding the Oddmu search engine

# SYNOPSIS

*oddmu search* _terms_...

# DESCRIPTION

The index indexes trigrams. Each group of three characters is a
trigram. A document with content "This is a test" is turned to lower
case and indexed under the trigrams "thi", "his", "is ", "s i", " is",
"is ", "s a", " a ", "a t", " te", "tes", "est".

Each query is split into words and then processed the same way. A
query with the words "this test" is turned to lower case and produces
the trigrams "thi", "his", "tes", "est". This means that the word
order is not considered when searching for documents.

This also means that there is no stemming. Searching for "testing"
won't find "This is a test" because there are no matches for the
trigrams "sti", "tin", "ing".

These trigrams are looked up in the index, resulting in the list of
documents. Each document found is then scored. Each of the following
increases the score by one point:

- the entire phrase matches
- a word matches
- a word matches at the beginning of a word
- a word matches at the end of a word
- a word matches as a whole word

A document with content "This is a test" when searched with the phrase
"this test" therefore gets a score of 8: the entire phrase does not
match but each word gets four points.

Trigrams are sometimes strange: In a text containing the words "main"
and "rail", a search for "mail" returns a match because the trigrams
"mai" and "ail" are found. In this situation, the result has a score
of 0.

The sorting of all the pages, however, does not depend on scoring!
Computing the score is expensive because the page must be loaded from
disk. Therefore, results are sorted by title:

- If the page title contains the query string, it gets sorted first.
- If the page name (the filename!) begins with a number, it is sorted
  descending.
- All other pages follow, sorted ascending.

The effect is that first, the pages with matches in the page title are
shown, and then all the others. Within these two groups, the most
recent blog posts are shown first. This assumes that blog pages start
with an ISO date like "2023-09-16".

The score and highlighting of snippets is used to help visitors decide
which links to click. A score of 0 indicates that all the trigrams
were found but _no exact matches_ for any of the terms.
