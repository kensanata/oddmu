ODDMU-STATIC(1)

# NAME

oddmu-static - create a static copy of the site

# SYNOPSIS

*oddmu static* _dir-name_

# DESCRIPTION

The "static" subcommand generates a static copy of the pages in the
current directory and saves them in the given target directory. The
target directory must not exist to unser no existing files are
clobbered.

All pages (files with the ".md" extension) are turned into HTML files
(with the ".html" extension). All other files are _linked_ into the
same directory.

Hidden files and directories (starting with a ".") and backup files
(ending with a "~") are skipped.

# EXAMPLE

Generate a static copy of the site:

```
oddmu static ../archive
```

# ENVIRONMENT

The ODDMU_WEBFINGER environment variable has no effect in this
situation. Fediverse accounts are not linked to their profile pages.
