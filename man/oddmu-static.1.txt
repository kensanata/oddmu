ODDMU-STATIC(1)

# NAME

oddmu-static - create a static copy of the site

# SYNOPSIS

*oddmu static* _dir-name_

# DESCRIPTION

The "static" subcommand generates a static copy of the pages in the
current directory and saves them in the given target directory. The
target directory must not exist to unser no existing files are
clobbered.

All pages (files with the ".md" extension) are turned into HTML files
(with the ".html" extension) using the "static.html" template. Links
pointing to existing pages get ".html" appended.

Hidden files and directories (starting with a ".") and backup files
(ending with a "~") are skipped.

All other files are _linked_ into the same directory.

# EXAMPLE

Generate a static copy of the site:

```
oddmu static ../archive
```

# LIMITATIONS

Links from files to pages do not get ".html" appended. This affects
existing HTML or XML files including SVG files.

Links to absolute URLs (starting with "/") are not changed at all. It
is up to you to migrate static folders and applications.

# ENVIRONMENT

The ODDMU_WEBFINGER environment variable has no effect in this
situation. Fediverse accounts are not linked to their profile pages.
