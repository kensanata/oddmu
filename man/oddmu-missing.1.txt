ODDMU-MISSING(1)

# NAME

oddmu-missing - list missing pages

# SYNOPSIS

*oddmu missing*

# DESCRIPTION

The "missing" subcommand lists pages and their local links that are missing.

Any links that seem like they might point outside the wiki are ignored: links
that start with a slash "/" and links that start with a known URL schema
(currently: "http:", "https:", "ftp:", "mailto:", "gopher:", "gemini:",
"finger:").

Notably, links that start with "../" are reported as missing.

# EXAMPLES

Looking for broken links:

```
oddmu missing
```

Result:

```
Page	Missing
README	github.com/pemistahl/lingua-go
```

This shows how the README file had a link where the URL was missing the scheme
"https://".
