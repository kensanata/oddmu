oddmu-templates - how to write the templates
.PP
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
These files act as HTML templates: add.\&html, diff.\&html, edit.\&html, feed.\&html,
search.\&html, static.\&html, upload.\&html and view.\&html.\& They contain special
placeholders in double bracers {{like this}}.\&
.PP
.SH SYNTAX
.PP
The templates can refer to the following properties of a page:
.PP
\fI{{.\&Title}}\fR is the page title.\& If the page doesn'\&t provide its own title, the
page name is used.\&
.PP
\fI{{.\&Name}}\fR is the page name, escaped for use in URLs.\& More specifically, it is
percent-escaped except for the slashes.\& The page name doesn'\&t include the \fI.\&md\fR
extension.\&
.PP
\fI{{.\&Dir}}\fR is the page directory, percent-escaped except for the slashes.\&
.PP
\fI{{.\&Base}}\fR is the basename of the current file (without the directory and
without the \fI.\&md\fR extension), escaped for use in URLs.\&
.PP
\fI{{.\&Today}}\fR is the current date, in ISO format.\& This is useful for "new page"
like links or forms (see \fBEXAMPLE\fR below).\&
.PP
For the \fIview.\&html\fR and \fIstatic.\&html\fR template:
.PP
\fI{{.\&Html}}\fR is the rendered Markdown, as HTML.\&
.PP
\fI{{.\&Hashtags}}\fR is an array of strings.\&
.PP
For the \fIdiff.\&html\fR template:
.PP
\fI{{.\&Diff}}\fR is the diff for this page.\& This is only computed on demand so it can
be used in other templates, too.\& It probably doesn'\&t make much sense to do so,
however.\&
.PP
For the \fIedit.\&html\fR template:
.PP
\fI{{printf "%s" .\&Body}}\fR is the Markdown, as a string (the data itself is a byte
array and that'\&s why we need to call \fIprintf\fR).\&
.PP
For the \fIsearch.\&html\fR template only:
.PP
\fI{{.\&Previous}}\fR, \fI{{.\&Page}}\fR and \fI{{.\&Next}}\fR are the previous, current and next
page number in the results since doing arithmetics in templates is hard.\& The
first page number is 1.\& The last page is expensive to dermine and so that isn'\&t
done.\&
.PP
\fI{{.\&More}}\fR indicates if there are any more search results.\&
.PP
\fI{{.\&Results}}\fR indicates if there were any search results at all.\&
.PP
\fI{{.\&Items}}\fR is an array of pages, each containing a search result.\& A search
result is a page (with the properties seen above).\& Thus, to refer to them, you
need to use a \fI{{range .\&Items}}\fR … \fI{{end}}\fR construct.\&
.PP
For items in the search result:
.PP
\fI{{.\&Html}}\fR is the rendered Markdown of a page summary, as HTML.\&
.PP
\fI{{.\&Score}}\fR is a numerical score for search results.\&
.PP
For the \fIfeed.\&html\fR template:
.PP
\fI{{.\&Name}}\fR is the page name, escaped for use in URLs.\&
.PP
\fI{{.\&Title}}\fR is the title of the underlying main page.\&
.PP
\fI{{.\&Date}}\fR is the date of the last update to the underlying main page, in RFC
822 format.\&
.PP
\fI{{.\&Items}}\fR is an array of feed items.\&
.PP
For items in the feed:
.PP
\fI{{.\&Name}}\fR is the page name, escaped for use in URLs.\&
.PP
\fI{{.\&Title}}\fR is the title of the page.\&
.PP
\fI{{.\&Html}}\fR is the rendered Markdown, as escaped (!\&) HTML.\&
.PP
\fI{{.\&Hashtags}}\fR is an array of strings.\&
.PP
\fI{{.\&Date}}\fR, the date of the last update to this page, in RFC 822 format.\&
.PP
The \fIupload.\&html\fR template cannot refer to anything.\&
.PP
.SS Non-English hyphenation
.PP
Automatic hyphenation by the browser requires two things: The style sheet must
indicate "hyphen: auto" for an HTML element such as "body", and that element
must have a "lang" set (usually a two letter language code such as "de" for
German).\&
.PP
Oddmu attempts to detect the correct language for each page.\& It assumes that
languages are not mixed on the same page.\& If you know that you'\&re only going to
use a small number of languages – or just a single language!\& – you can set the
environment variable ODDMU_LANGUAGES to a comma-separated list of ISO 639-1
codes, e.\&g.\& "en" or "en,de,fr,pt".\&
.PP
"view.\&html" is used the template to render a single page and so the language
detected is added to the "html" element.\&
.PP
"search.\&html" is the template used to render search results and so "en" is used
for the "html" element and the language detected for every page in the search
result is added to the "article" element for each snippet.\&
.PP
"edit.\&html" and "add.\&html" are the templates used to edit a page and at that
point, the language isn'\&t known, so "en" is used for the "html" element and no
language is used for the "textarea" element.\&
.PP
.SH EXAMPLE
.PP
The following link in a template takes people to today'\&s page.\& If no such page
exists, they are redirected to the edit form where it can be created.\&
.PP
.nf
.RS 4
<a href="/view/{{\&.Today}}" accesskey="t">Today</a>
.fi
.RE
.PP
The following form allows people to edit the suggested page name.\&
.PP
.nf
.RS 4
<form role="new" action="/edit/{{\&.Dir}}" method="GET">
  <label for="id">New page:</label>
  <input id="id" type="text" spellcheck="false" name="id"
	  accesskey="g" value="{{\&.Today}}" required>
  <button>Edit</button>
</form>
.fi

.SH NOTES
.PP
The templates are always used as-is, irrespective of the current directory.\&
Therefore, a link to a specific page must be \fIabsolute\fR or it'\&ll point to a
different page depending on the current directory.\&
.PP
Consider the link to "/view/index".\& No matter what page a visitor is looking,
this takes visitors to the top "index" page.\& If the link points to "index"
instead, it takes a visitor to the "index" page of the current directory.\& In
this case, a visitor looking at "/view/projects/wiki" following a link to
"index" ends up on "/view/projects/index", not on "/view/index".\&
.PP
It'\&s up to you to decide what'\&s best for your site, of course.\&
.PP
Templates can be changed by uploading new copies of the template files.\&
.PP
Subdirectories can have their own copies of template files.\& One example use for
this is that they can point to a different CSS file.\&
