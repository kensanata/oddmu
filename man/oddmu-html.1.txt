ODDMU-HTML(1)

# NAME

oddmu-html - render Oddmu page HTML

# SYNOPSIS

*oddmu html* [-view] _page-name_

# DESCRIPTION

The "html" subcommand opens the Markdown file for the given page name (appending
the ".md" extension) and prints the HTML to STDOUT without invoking the
"view.html" template. Use "-" as the page name if you want to read Markdown from
*stdin*.

# OPTIONS

*-view*
	Use the "view.html" template to render the page. Without this, the HTML
	lacks html and body tags.

# EXAMPLE

Generate "README.html" from "README.md":

```
oddmu html README > README.html
```

Alternatively:

```
oddmu html - < README.md > README.html
```
