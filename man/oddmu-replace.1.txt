ODDMU-REPLACE(1)

# NAME

oddmu-replace - replace text in Oddmu pages from the command-line

# SYNOPSIS

*oddmu replace* [-confirm] [-regexp] _term_ _replacement_

# DESCRIPTION

The "replace" subcommand does a search and replace on all the Markdown
files in the current directory and its subdirectories.

# OPTIONS

*-confirm*
	By default, the replacement doesn't save the changes made.
	Instead, a unified diff is produced and printed. Given this
	option, the changed Markdown files are saved to disk.

*-regexp*
	By default, the term to be replaced is just a string. With
	this flag, the term is a regular expression and the
	replacement can contain backreferences ($1, $2, $3, etc.) to
	capture groups.

# EXAMPLE

Replace "Oddmu" in the Markdown files of the current directory:

```
oddmu replace Oddmu OddÂµ
```

Result:

```
--- README.md~
+++ README.md

(diff omitted)

1 file would be changed.
This is a dry run. Use -confirm to make it happen.
```

# NOTES

This is the equivalent of using _sed_(1) with the --quiet,
\--regexp-extended, --in-place=~ and --expression command with the s
command "s/regexp/replacement/g" except that it prints a unified diff
per default instead of making any changes and the regexp rules differ
slightly.

The search is case-sensitive. To make it case-insensitive, search for
a regular expression that sets the case-insensitive flag, e.g.
"(?i)oddmu".
