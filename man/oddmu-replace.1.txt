ODDMU-REPLACE(1)

# NAME

oddmu-replace - replace text in Oddmu pages from the command-line

# SYNOPSIS

*oddmu replace* [-confirm] _regexp_ _replacement_

# DESCRIPTION

The "replace" subcommand replaces the Markdown files in the current
directory (!), returning the replace result as a Markdown-formatted
list.

# OPTIONS

*-confirm*
	By default, the replacement doesn't save the changes made.
	Instead, a unified diff is produced and printed. Given this
	option, the changed Markdown files are saved to disk.

# EXAMPLE

Replace for "oddmu" in the Markdown files of the current directory:

```
oddmu replace oddmu
```

Result:

```
Replace oddmu: 1 result
* [OddÂµ: A minimal wiki](README) (5)
```

# NOTES

This is the equivalent of using _sed_(1) with the --quiet,
\--regexp-extended, --in-place=~ and --expression command with the s
command "s/regexp/replacement/g" except that it prints a unified diff
per default instead of making any changes and the regexp rules differ
slightly.
