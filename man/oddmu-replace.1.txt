ODDMU-REPLACE(1)

# NAME

oddmu-replace - replace text in Oddmu pages from the command-line

# SYNOPSIS

*oddmu replace* [-confirm] _regexp_ _replacement_

# DESCRIPTION

The "replace" subcommand replaces the Markdown files in the current
directory (!), returning the replace result as a Markdown-formatted
list.

The use of a trigram index makes it possible to find substrings and
for the word order not to matter, but it also makes the replace results
a bit harder to understand. See _oddmu-replace_(7) for more.

# OPTIONS

*-confirm*
	By default, the replacement doesn't save the changes made.
        Instead, a unified diff is produced and printed. Given this
        option, the changed Markdown files are saved to disk.

# EXAMPLE

Replace for "oddmu" in the Markdown files of the current directory:

```
oddmu replace oddmu
```

Result:

```
Replace oddmu: 1 result
* [OddÂµ: A minimal wiki](README) (5)
```
