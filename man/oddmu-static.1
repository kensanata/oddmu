oddmu-static - create a static copy of the site
.PP
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBoddmu static\fR \fIdir-name\fR
.PP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The "static" subcommand generates a static copy of the pages in the current
directory and saves them in the given destination directory.\& Existing files are
only overwritten if they are older than the source file.\&
.PP
All pages (files with the ".\&md" extension) are turned into HTML files (with the
".\&html" extension) using the "static.\&html" template.\& Links pointing to existing
pages get ".\&html" appended.\&
.PP
If a page has a name case-insensitively matching a hashtag, a feed file is
generated (ending with ".\&rss") if any suitable links are found.\& A suitable link
for a feed item must appear in a bullet list item using an asterisk ("*").\& If
no feed items are found, no feed is written.\&
.PP
Hidden files and directories (starting with a ".\&") and backup files (ending with
a "~") are skipped.\&
.PP
All other files are \fIhard linked\fR.\& This is done to save space: on a typical blog
the images take a lot more space than the text.\& On my blog in 2023 I had 2.\&62
GiB of JPG files and 0.\&02 GiB of Markdown files.\& There is no point in copying
all those images, most of the time.\&
.PP
Note, however: Hard links cannot span filesystems.\& A hard link is just an extra
name for the same file.\& This is why the destination directory for the static
site has to be on same filesystem as the current directory, if it contains any
other files besides Markdown files.\&
.PP
Furthermore, in-place editing changes the file for all names.\& Avoid editing the
hard-linked files (anything that'\&s not a HTML file) in the destination
directory, just to be on the safe side.\& Usually you should be fine, as an editor
moves the file that'\&s being edited to a backup file and creates a new file.\& But
then again, who knows.\& A SQLite file, for example, would change in-place, and
therefore making changes to it in the destination directory would change the
original, too.\&
.PP
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
Generate a static copy of the site, but only loading language detection for
German and English, significantly reducing the time it takes to generate the
static site:
.PP
.nf
.RS 4
env ODDMU_LANGUAGES=de,en oddmu static \&.\&./archive
.fi
.RE
.PP
.SH LIMITATIONS
.PP
There can be nameclashes with generated HTML and RSS files and existing files
ending in ".\&html" and ".\&rss".\& Instead of overwriting existing files in these
cases, a warning is printed.\&
.PP
Links from files to pages do not get ".\&html" appended.\& This affects existing
HTML or XML files including SVG files.\&
.PP
Links to absolute URLs (starting with "/") are not changed at all.\& It is up to
you to migrate static folders and applications.\&
.PP
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.PP
The ODDMU_WEBFINGER environment variable has no effect in this situation.\&
Fediverse accounts are not linked to their profile pages.\& Since the data isn'\&t
cached, every run of this command would trigger a webfinger request for every
fediverse account mentioned.\&
.PP
If the site is large, determining the language of a page slows things down.\& Set
the ODDMU_LANGUAGES environment variable to a comma-separated list of ISO 639-1
codes, e.\&g.\& "en" or "en,de,fr,pt" to limit the languages loaded and thereby
speed language determination up.\&
