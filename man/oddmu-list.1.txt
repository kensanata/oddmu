ODDMU-LIST(1)

# NAME

oddmu-list - list page names and titles from the command-line

# SYNOPSIS

*oddmu list* [-dir string]

# DESCRIPTION

The "list" subcommand lists page names and their titles, separated by a TAB
character. This saves you from opening and parsing all the files yourself if you
need the page titles.

If a directory is provided, only files from the tree starting at that
subdirectory are listed, and the directory is stripped from the page name.

# OPTIONS

*-dir* _string_
	Limit the list to a particular directory.

# EXAMPLE

Create list of links to pages in the "dad" directory, filter it for date pages
(starting with "2"), format it as a list of links and sort in reverse order.
This is a list of links you could append to "dad/index.md" if it doesn't already
have a list of links.

```
oddmu list -dir dad \
| grep '^2' \
| awk -F "\t" -e '{ print "* [" $2 "](" $1 ")" }' \
| sort -r
```
