oddmu.\&service - how to setup Oddmu using systemd
.PP
.SS DESCRIPTION
.PP
Here'\&s how to setup a wiki using systemd such that it starts automatically when
the system boots and gets restarted automatically when it crashes.\&
.PP
First, create a new user called "oddmu" with it'\&s own home directory but without
a login.\&
.PP
.nf
.RS 4
adduser --system --home /home/oddmu oddmu
.fi
.RE
.PP
The directory "/home/oddmu" contains the templates and all the data files.\& Copy
all the templates files ending in ".\&html" from the source distribution to
"/home/oddmu".\&
.PP
If you want to keep everything in one place, copy the binary "oddmu" and the
service file "oddmu.\&service" to "/home/oddmu", too.\&
.PP
Edit the "oddmu.\&service" file.\& These are the lines you most likely have to take
care of:
.PP
.nf
.RS 4
ExecStart=/home/oddmu/oddmu
WorkingDirectory=/home/oddmu
ReadWritePaths=/home/oddmu
Environment="ODDMU_PORT=8080"
Environment="ODDMU_WEBFINGER=1"
.fi
.RE
.PP
Install the service file and enable it:
.PP
.nf
.RS 4
ln -s /home/oddmu/oddmu\&.service /etc/systemd/system/
systemctl enable --now oddmu
.fi
.RE
.PP
You should be able to visit the wiki at http://localhost:8080/.\&
.PP
Check the log:
.PP
.nf
.RS 4
journalctl --unit oddmu
.fi
.RE
.PP
Follow the log:
.PP
.nf
.RS 4
journalctl --follow --unit oddmu
.fi
.RE
.PP
.SH Socket Activation
.PP
Alternatively, you can let systemd handle the creation of the listening socket,
passing it to Oddmu.\& See "oddmu-unix-domain.\&service" and
"oddmu-unix-domain.\&socket" for a fully worked example of how to do this with a
Unix domain socket.\& Take note of "Accept=no" in the .\&socket file and
"StandardInput=socket" in the .\&service file.\& The option "StandardInput=socket"
tells systemd to pass the socket to the service as its standard input.\&
"Accept=no" tells systemd to pass a listening socket, rather than to try calling
Oddmu for each connection.\&
.PP
Instead of using "oddmu.\&service", you need to use "oddmu-unix-domain.\&socket" and
"oddmu-unix-domain.\&service".\&
.PP
The unit file for the socket defines a file name.\& You probably need to create
the directory or change the file name.\&
.PP
.nf
.RS 4
sudo mkdir /run/oddmu
.fi
.RE
.PP
The unit file for the service defines where the "oddmu" is and where the data
directory is.\& These are the lines you most likely have to take care of:
.PP
.nf
.RS 4
ExecStart=/home/oddmu/oddmu
WorkingDirectory=/home/oddmu
ReadWritePaths=/home/oddmu
Environment="ODDMU_PORT=8080"
Environment="ODDMU_WEBFINGER=1"
.fi
.RE
.PP
To install, enable and start both units:
.PP
.nf
.RS 4
ln -s /home/oddmu/oddmu-unix-domain\&.socket /etc/systemd/system
ln -s /home/oddmu/oddmu-unix-domain\&.service /etc/systemd/system
systemctl enable --now oddmu-unix-domain\&.socket
systemctl enable --now oddmu-unix-domain\&.service
.fi
.RE
.PP
To test just the unix domain socket, use \fIncat(1)\fR:
.PP
.nf
.RS 4
echo -e "GET /view/index HTTP/1\&.1rnHost: localhostrnrn" 
  | ncat --unixsock /run/oddmu/oddmu\&.sock
.fi
.RE
.PP
Now you need to set up your web browser to use the Unix domain socket.\& See
\fIoddmu-apache\fR(5) or \fIoddmu-nginx\fR(5) for example configurations.\&
.PP
.SS A personal wiki
.PP
On a single user machine, it might be useful to have a single wiki for the main
user available, on the standard port (80).\& In order to do this, setup a "user"
unit using systemd and save the following as "user-unix-domain.\&service":
.PP
.nf
.RS 4
[Unit]
Description=Oddmu
After=network\&.target
[Install]
WantedBy=default\&.target
[Service]
Type=simple
Restart=always
StandardOutput=journal
StandardError=journal
ExecStart=/home/alex/src/oddmu/oddmu
WorkingDirectory=/home/alex/wiki
Environment="ODDMU_PORT=80"
Environment="ODDMU_LANGUAGES=de,en"
.fi
.RE
.PP
Since this is a priviledged port, the binary needs an extra capability for an
ordinary user to do this.\& This is necessary so that the files are created and
owned by the same user.\& Otherwise, the regular user wouldn'\&t be able to edit the
files using their favourite text editor.\&
.PP
.nf
.RS 4
sudo setcap \&'cap_net_bind_service=+ep\&' oddmu
.fi
.RE
.PP
Note that as soon as you recomile, the capability is gone again and the above
must be repeated.\&
.PP
Install it:
.PP
.nf
.RS 4
systemctl --user enable --now user-unix-domain\&.service
.fi
.RE
.PP
To examine the log:
.PP
.nf
.RS 4
journalctl --user --unit user-unix-domain\&.service
.fi
