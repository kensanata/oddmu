ODDMU-FEED(1)

# NAME

oddmu-feed - render Oddmu page feed

# SYNOPSIS

*oddmu feed* _page-name_ ...

# DESCRIPTION

The "feed" subcommand opens the given Markdown files and writes the resulting
RSS files without item limit (ordinarily, this default is 10 items per feed).
This uses the "feed.html" template. Use "-" as the page name if you want to read
Markdown from *stdin*.

Unlike the feeds generated by the *static* subcommand, the *feed* command does
not limit the feed to the ten most recent items. Instead, all items on the list
are turned into feed items.

# EXAMPLES

Generate "emacs.rss" from "emacs.md":

```
oddmu feed emacs.md
```

Alternatively:

```
oddmu feed - < emacs.md > emacs.rss
```
