.PP
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBoddmu list\fR [-dir string]
.PP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The "list" subcommand lists page names and their titles, separated by a TAB
character.\& This saves you from opening and parsing all the files yourself if you
need the page titles.\&
.PP
If a directory is provided, only files from the tree starting at that
subdirectory are listed, and the directory is stripped from the page name.\&
.PP
.SH OPTIONS

.SH EXAMPLE

Create list of links to pages in the "dad" directory, filter it for date pages
(starting with "2"), format it as a list of links and sort in reverse order.\&
This is a list of links you could append to "dad/index.\&md" if it doesn'\&t already
have a list of links.\&
