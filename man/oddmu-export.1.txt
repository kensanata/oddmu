ODDMU-EXPORT(1)

# NAME

oddmu-export - export all pages into one file

# SYNOPSIS

*oddmu export*

# DESCRIPTION

The "export" subcommand prints a RSS file containing all the pages to stdout.
You probably want to redirect this into a file so that you can upload and import
it somewhere.

Note that this only handles pages (Markdown files). All other files (images,
PDFs, whatever else you uploaded) are not part of the feed and has to be
uploaded to the new platform in some other way.

# FILES

The export uses the **feed.html** template in the current directory.

# EXAMPLE

Export all the pages into a big XML file:

```
oddmu export > /tmp/export.xml
```
