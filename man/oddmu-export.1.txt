ODDMU-EXPORT(1)

# NAME

oddmu-export - export all pages into one file

# SYNOPSIS

*oddmu export* [*-template* _filename_]

# DESCRIPTION

The "export" subcommand prints a RSS file containing all the pages to stdout.
You probably want to redirect this into a file so that you can upload and import
it somewhere.

Note that this only handles pages (Markdown files). All other files (images,
PDFs, whatever else you uploaded) are not part of the feed and have to be
uploaded to the new platform using some other way.

The *-template* option specifies the template to use. If the template filename
ends in _.xml_, _.html_ or _.rss_, it is assumed to contain XML and the optional
XML preamble is printed and appropriate escaping rules are used.

# FILES

By default, the export uses the **feed.html** template in the current directory.

# EXAMPLES

Export all the pages into a big XML file:

```
env ODDMU_LANGUAGES=de,en oddmu export > /tmp/export.xml
```

Alternatively, consider a template file like the following, to generate a JSON
feed. The rule to disallow a comma at the end of arrays means that we need to
add an empty tag and an empty item, unfortunately:

```
{
  "version": "https://jsonfeed.org/version/1.1",
  "title": "{{.Title}}",
  "home_page_url": "https://alexschroeder.ch",
  "others": [],
  "items": [{{range .Items}}
    {
      "id": "{{.Name}}",
      "url": "https://alexschroeder.ch/view/{{.Name}}",
      "title": "{{.Title}}",
      "content_html": "{{.Html}}",
      "date_modified": "{{.Date}}",
      "tags": [{{range .Hashtags}}"{{.}}",{{end}}""],
      "language": "{{.Language}}"
    },{{end}}
    {}
  ]
}
```
