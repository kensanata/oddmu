ODDMU-HASHTAGS(1)

# NAME

oddmu-hashtags - work with hashtags

# SYNOPSIS

*oddmu hashtags*

*oddmu hashtags -update* [*-dry-run*]

# DESCRIPTION

By default, the "hashtags" subcommand counts all the hashtags used and lists
them, separated by a TAB character.

With the *-update* flag, the hashtag pages are update with links to all the blog
pages having the corresponding tag. This only necessary when migrating a
collection of Markdown files. Ordinarily, Oddmu maintains the hashtag pages
automatically. When writing pages offline, use _oddmu-notify_(1) to update the
hashtag pages.

Use the *-dry-run* flag to see what would change with the *-update* flag without
actually changing any files.

# EXAMPLES

List the top 10 hashtags. This requires 11 lines because of the header line.

```
oddmu hashtags | head -n 11
```

See what kind of changes Oddmu would suggest:

```
oddmu hashtags -update -dry-run
```

And then do it:

```
oddmu hashtags -update
```
