.SH NAME

oddmu-notify - add links to changes.\&md, index.\&md, and hashtag pages
.PP
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBoddmu notify\fR \fIpage names.\&.\&.\&\fR 
.PP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The "notify" subcommand takes all the page names provided (without the ".\&md"
extension) and adds links to it from other pages.\&
.PP
A new link is added to the \fBchanges\fR page in the current directory if it doesn'\&t
exist.\& The current date of the machine Oddmu is running on is used as the
heading.\& If the requested link already exists on the changes page, it is moved
up to the current date.\& If that leaves an old date without any links, that date
heading is removed.\&
.PP
A page whose name starts with an ISO date (YYYY-MM-DD, e.\&g.\& "2023-10-28") is
called a \fBblog\fR page.\&
.PP
A link is created from the \fBindex\fR page in the current directory to blog pages
if and only if the blog pages are from the current year.\& The idea is that the
front page contains a lot of links to blog posts but eventually the blog post
links are moved onto archive pages (one per year, for example), or simply
deleted.\& As when editing older pages, links to those pages should not get added
to the index as if those older pages were new again.\& A link on the changes page
is enough.\&
.PP
For every \fBhashtag\fR used on the pages named, another link might be created.\& If a
page named like the hashtag exists, a backlink is added to it.\& A hashtag
consists of a number sign ('\&#'\&) followed by Unicode letters, numbers or the
underscore ('\&_'\&).\& Thus, a hashtag ends with punctuation or whitespace.\&
.PP
If a link already exists but it'\&s title is no longer correct, it is updated.\&
.PP
New links added for blog pages are added at the top of the first unnumbered list
using the asterisk ('\&*'\&).\& If no such list exists, a new one is started at the
bottom of the page.\& This allows you to have a different unnumbered list further
up on the page, as long as it uses the minus for items ('\&-'\&).\&

.SH EXAMPLES
