.SH NAME
.PP
oddmu-notify - add links to changes.\&md, index.\&md, and hashtag pages
.PP
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBoddmu notify\fR \fIpage names.\&.\&.\&\fR 
.PP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The "notify" subcommand takes all the page names provided (without the ".\&md"
extension) and adds links to it from other pages.\&
.PP
A new link is added to the \fBchanges\fR page if it doesn'\&t exist.\& The current date
of the machine Oddmu is running on is used as the heading.\& If the requested link
already exists on the changes page, it is moved up to the current date.\& If that
leaves an old date without any links, that date heading is removed.\&
.PP
A page whose name starts with an ISO date (YYYY-MM-DD, e.\&g.\& "2023-10-28") is
called a \fBblog\fR page.\& A link created is from the \fBindex\fR page to blog pages.\&
.PP
For every \fBhashtag\fR used on the pages named, another link might be created.\& If a
page named like the hashtag exists, a backlink is added to it.\& A hashtag
consists of a number sign ('\&#'\&) followed by Unicode letters, numbers or the
underscore ('\&_'\&).\& Thus, a hashtag ends with punctuation or whitespace.\&
.PP
If a link already exists but it'\&s title is no longer correct, it is updated.\&
.PP
New links added for blog pages are added at the top of the first unnumbered list
using the asterisk ('\&*'\&).\& If no such list exists, a new one is started at the
bottom of the page.\& This allows you to have a different unnumbered list further
up on the page, as long as it uses the minus for items ('\&-'\&).\&
.PP
.SH EXAMPLE
.PP
After writing the file "2023-11-05-climate.\&md" containing the hashtag
"#Climate", add links to it from "index.\&md", "changes.\&md", and "Climate.\&md" (if
it exists):
