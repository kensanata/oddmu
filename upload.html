    <h1>Upload File</h1>
    <form action="/drop/{{.}}" method="POST" enctype="multipart/form-data">
      <p>When uploading pictures from a phone, its filename is going to be something cryptic like IMG_1234.JPG.
        Please provide your own filename.
      <p><label>Filename to use: <input type="text" name="name" placeholder="image.jpg" autofocus required></label>
      <p>If the uploaded file is a picture from a phone, it's size is going to be too big for a regular site.
        Feel free to specify a max width of 1200 pixels, for example.
      <p><label>Max width: <input type="number" min="10" name="maxwidth" placeholder="1200"></label>
      <p>If the uploaded file is a JPEG-encoded picture, like most pictures from a phone, you can specify a quality.
        Typically, a quality of 60 is not too bad and a quality of 90 is more than enough.
      <p><label>Quality: <input type="number" min="1" max="99" name="quality" placeholder="80"></label>
      <p><input type="file" name="file" required>
      <p><input type="submit" value="Save">
        <a href="/view/index"><button type="button">Cancel</button></a></p>
    </form>
