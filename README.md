# A small Wiki written in Go

I'm the maintainer of [Oddmuse](http://oddmuse.org/), a wiki written
in Perl 5. As we wait for Perl 6 to come around, I wanted to
experiment with [Go](https://golang.org/). The article
[Writing Web Applications](https://golang.org/doc/articles/wiki/)
provided the initial code. [Cajun](https://github.com/m4tty/cajun)
provides the rendering engine for
[Wiki Creole](http://www.wikicreole.org/), the "standard" markup for
wikis.
