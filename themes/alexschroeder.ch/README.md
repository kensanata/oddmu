# Alex Schroeder theme

At the top there's a text input to quickly create new pages.

This theme comes with an external CSS file. If you plan to use
subdirectories for your site, you need to change the URL of the CSS in
the HTML templates to `/view/oddmu.css` or serve it as a static file
from a `/css` directory.

The CSS switches between light and dark mode based on the visitor's
setup.
