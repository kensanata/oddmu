# Transjovian theme

This theme uses a nearly-black background and bright blue links. In
other words, it always looks like dark mode. This could be annoying,
but the site is for "a group of people living in the outer reaches of
our system, beyond Jupiter", so always dark seems appropriate.

There's an added "Raw" link that links to the Markdown file for the page.
