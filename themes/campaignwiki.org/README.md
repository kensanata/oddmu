# Campaign Wiki theme

A beige theme that sticks close to the default. This site treats every
subdirectory as its own wiki and so there's a "Changes" link to the
local changes files and a "Zip" link to download the current
directory. This is so people can download a backup of their data.

On the real site, the link to the zip file on the top level is
unavailable because of a redirect so that people download only their
own wikis and not all the wikis, for bandwidth reasons. This is part
of the Apache config, however.
