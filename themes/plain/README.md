Plain theme
===========

This makes it look as if the site consists mostly of editable plain
text. Accordingly, the user interface has been simplified and there
are no links to the add, diff and upload actions and the corresponding
templates have been deleted. There is no special static or feed
template (mostly because the feed would depend on the list of links
that isn't rendered).

Now, the text is still saved in Markdown files and the Markdown is
still rendered to HTML â€“ but the "view" template just prints the page
body inside a "pre" block and ignores the rendered HTML.

This is why there's no link here back to themes. Sorry!
